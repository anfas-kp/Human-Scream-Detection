# Scream Detection Project

## Project Description
This project implements a scream detection system using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It provides two main components:
- A Flask web application that allows users to upload audio files (wav, mp3) and predicts whether the audio contains a scream. The app also generates waveform and amplitude distribution plots for scream audio.
- A real-time scream detection script that captures audio from the microphone, performs live scream detection, and visualizes the audio waveform and amplitude distribution with live updates.

## Features
- Audio file upload and scream detection via web interface.
- Real-time scream detection from microphone input.
- Visualization of audio waveform and amplitude distribution.
- Confidence score and audio feature extraction.
- Emergency alert placeholder for scream detection in real-time script.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Ml_Project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Flask Web Application

1. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

3. Upload an audio file (wav or mp3) to detect screams. The app will display the prediction, confidence score, audio features, and plots if a scream is detected.

4. start realtime audio detection option in web app to capture audio from the microphone and perform live scream detection.The app will display the prediction, confidence score, audio features, and plots if a scream is detected.

### Real-Time Scream Detection Script

1. Run the real-time detection script:
   ```bash
   python real_world_detecting_2.py
   ```

2. The script will start recording audio from your microphone and display live waveform and amplitude distribution plots.

3. Predictions and audio features will be printed in the console. An emergency alert message will be shown if a scream is detected.

## Model

The project uses a 1D CNN model (`scream_1d_cnn_model.h5`) to classify audio clips as scream or not scream. The model expects 2-second audio clips sampled at 16kHz.
